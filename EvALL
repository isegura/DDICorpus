NEW!
DDIExtraction goldstandard is now available via EvALL. EvALL is an evaluation web service that is lunching in the NLP&IR research group of UNED. It allows researchers to evaluate their systems outputs according to several metrics. EvALL also allows researchers to publish their system outputs to an already stored goldstandard, (benchmark in EvALL), in the EvALL repository. Including your outputs in EvALL will allow future researchers working with this dataset to see your approaches, compare with them, explore your papers, and cite them, between others. You can find more information about EvALL in the next video.

In order to submit your system outputs you only need to:

1.- Prepare the system output. EvALL uses a tsv file format with three columns. The first one is the TEST CASE (in this dataset is “DDI2013”), the second is the ID of the elements and the third one is the class assigned to the ID:

"DDI2013" "DDI-DrugBank.d712.s1.p0" "2"

2.- Register and login. In the top right corner of the screen you can see the “Sign in” button. Click it and follow the steps.

3.- In the home menu, click on the option “Publish a new system output”.

4.- Select the DDIExtraction benchmark and follow the steps. With just 3 clicks you can upload the output.

5.- Fill in the form with the information about your output, the authors, the link to the pdf, the bibtext, etc.

6.- Save and go the the “Browse repository” option to see if everything is allrigth.

Remember that this is an alphan version, so if you have any problem do not hesitate to contact with the EvALL Team: Jorge Carrillo-de-Albornoz or Enrique Amigó
